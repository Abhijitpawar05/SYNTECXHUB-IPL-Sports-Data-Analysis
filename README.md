# SYNTECXHUB-IPL-Sports-Data-Analysis
IPL Data Analysis project using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore player performance, team win rates, strike rates, and season-wise scoring trends.
🏏 IPL Data Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset. The objective of this analysis is to uncover meaningful insights related to player performance, team dominance, match trends, and season-wise scoring patterns using Python and data visualization techniques.

The dataset includes match-level and ball-by-ball data, enabling detailed statistical analysis of batting, bowling, and team performance.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze overall batting performance in IPL history

Identify top run scorers and consistent performers

Calculate strike rates of batsmen

Determine team win percentages

Study season-wise total run trends

Compare player performance across multiple seasons

Identify leading wicket-taking bowlers

📂 Dataset Information
The project uses two datasets:
matches.csv – Contains match-level information such as season, teams, venue, and winner.
deliveries.csv – Contains ball-by-ball data including batsman runs, total runs, dismissals, and bowling details.
These datasets were merged where necessary to perform season-wise and player-wise analysis.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python

Pandas – Data manipulation and aggregation

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Seaborn – Statistical plotting

Jupyter Notebook – Development environment

🔍 Key Analysis Performed
1️⃣ Top Run Scorers
Grouped data by batsman

Calculated total runs scored

Identified top performers

2️⃣ Strike Rate Analysis

Computed total balls faced

Calculated strike rate using:

Strike Rate = (Total Runs / Total Balls Faced) × 100

Identified aggressive batsmen

3️⃣ Team Win Percentage

Calculated total matches played

Calculated matches won

Derived win percentage for each team

4️⃣ Season-wise Run Trends

Merged match and delivery datasets

Calculated total runs per season

Analyzed scoring trend evolution

5️⃣ Player Performance Comparison

Compared individual player statistics across seasons

Identified consistency and peak performance years

6️⃣ Bowling Analysis

Identified top wicket-taking bowlers

Analyzed bowling impact on match outcomes

📊 Key Insights
A small group of players consistently dominate IPL batting charts.

Teams with higher win percentages demonstrate long-term stability and strong squad performance.

Season-wise analysis indicates a rise in total scoring over the years, reflecting aggressive modern T20 gameplay.

Strike rate analysis highlights the difference between anchor players and power hitters.

Player performance fluctuates across seasons due to form, strategy, and match conditions.
